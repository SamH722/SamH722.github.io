title: "About me"

---
 I am a junior Aerospace Engineering student at North Carolina State University with a 3.83 GPA and consistent Dean’s List recognition, expected to graduate in Spring 2027. I have a strong foundation in aerodynamics, structures, dynamics, and thermo-fluids, with hands-on experience in CAD, simulation, and engineering analysis using tools such as SolidWorks, MATLAB, XFOIL, ANSYS, and OpenVSP.
